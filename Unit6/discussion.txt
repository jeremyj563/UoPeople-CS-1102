When the program is executed a small empty window is created with a title bar that is set to the text 'COME CLOSER'. When the user hovers the mouse cursor over the window the title text is then set to 'I SEE YOU'. If the mouse is clicked while still hovering over the window the title text is set to 'LET GO' and then 'WHEW' when the mouse button is released. Immediately after clicking in the window the title text is set to 'OUCH'.
